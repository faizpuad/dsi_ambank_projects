### Summary of Project Analysis

Trend of each dataset is analysed. Some brief insight gain:
- Higher population is found to cause lower total marks of each test
- Higher tuition cost fees in a state tend to have better scoring marks
- Higher cost of living (reflecting higher income state) also  tend to have better scoring marks

### Conclusions And Recommendation
- at least median mark for scores to achieve
- high living cost is also associate with stricter n more achiever result in that area
-also choose school that is non optional test for higher chance
- low participant school show greater marks in each test.
- sat has higher particpation mean than act
- cost of tuition fees, living, participation, lowest & ideal scores mark are recommended features for new student to consider when selecting which entrance test to pick for which type of college.
